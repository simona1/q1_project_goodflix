## What is GoodFlix?
GoodFlix is an app that allows the user to search books or movies.

## APIs used
- Querying the book information - the goodreads API

GoodFlix is my Galvanize Q1 project. It was built inside a Vagrant Virtual Machine.
I used `Node.js` and the following node modules and technologies: 
- `express` web framework
- `webpack` module bundler
- `react` JS
- `babel` transforms
- `materialize-css` and `material-icons` for styling 
- `node-fetch` for handling promises
- `xml2js`, `query-string`, and `body-parser` for processing XML
